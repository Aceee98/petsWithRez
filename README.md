# TamaPets

This project was created, envisioned to be a virtual pet game, similarly to the legendary Tamagotchi. 
Using Pygame, TamaPets was made to be a fun and interactive game for all ages but aimed for the younger generation due to its simplicity and ease of use.

## Installation

The installation was made to be as simple as possible, with the addition of the file: `installPackages.py`, the installation process should be seamless and automatically start the Tamagotchi game. 

In the event that this file does not work, please run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

```bash
pip install python-tkdnd
```

## Usage

To run the game, simply open the terminal and run the following command(in the same directory as the main.py file):

```bash
python main.py
```


Following this, the game should open and you are able to use the button at the top right hand side of the screen to change pets, save and load the game.
Lastly, you are able to interact with the pet by clicking the buttons located towards the bottom of the screen.
